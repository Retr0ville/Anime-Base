# Anime-Base
Jikan Api implementation for MyAnimeList.net
 hosted on http://malbase-721e8.web.app/
>Malbase is an anime library for myanimelist users. It queries a username from Jikan API and returns the watchlist of that account in different categories such as on-hold, completed, plan-to-watch, dropped, e.t.c. the cards are fully responsive and paginated. I used semanticUI component library for its design.
